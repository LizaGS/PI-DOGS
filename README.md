# My First Complete Individual Project - About Dogs

<img height="200" src="./dog.png" />

My objective was to build a Single Page Application(SPA) from scratch given a certain initial boiler plate. I had to connect sequelize to a PostgreSQL database. In my case I had a many to many relationship between the models in the database so I had to make models and then connect them via sequelize to PostgreSQL.

For the project I used  [the dog api](https://thedogapi.com/).

The technologies I've used for this project were...
- React
- Redux
- Node
- Express
- Sequelize - Postgres
- CSS Modules

Deployed with Railway in the backend and Vercel in the frontend.
